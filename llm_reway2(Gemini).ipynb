Average precision for a particular relevant document is the area under the precision-recall curve up to the point where the document is retrieved. It takes into account both the relevance and the position of the relevant documents in the ranking.\n>\n>**Mean Average Precision Formula:**\n>\n>MAP = (1/m) * Σ (AP_i)\n>\n>where:\n>\n>m = total number of relevant documents in the dataset\n>AP_i = average precision for the i-th relevant document\n>\n>To calculate the MAP, the following steps are typically followed:\n>\n>1. Retrieve a ranked list of documents for a given query.\n>2. Identify the relevant documents in the ranked list.\n>3. Calculate the average precision (AP) for each relevant document.\n>4. Sum up all the AP values and divide by the total number of relevant documents to obtain the MAP.\n>\n>MAP is useful for evaluating ranking algorithms because it penalizes algorithms that retrieve relevant documents at lower positions in the ranking. A higher MAP score indicates that the ranking algorithm is more effective in retrieving relevant documents and placing them higher in the ranking. MAP is often used in conjunction with other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) to provide a comprehensive assessment of ranking performance."

Complex \\nNew Delhi-110 003, India, sandip@mit.gov.in  \\n \\n \\nAbstract \\n \\nElectronic waste (e-waste) is one of the \\nfastest growing waste streams in the \\ncountry. Growth of Information and \\nCommunication Technology sector has \\nenhanced the usage of the electronic \\nequipment \\nexponentially. \\nFaster \\nobsolescence and subsequent up-gradation \\nof \\nelectronics \\nproduct, \\nare \\nforcing \\nconsumers to discard old products, which \\nin turn accumulate huge e-waste to the \\nsolid waste stream. E-waste is growing in \\nIndia at the rate of 10%. Major recycling \\nof e-waste is carried out in the non-formal \\nsector using primitive and hazardous \\nmethods. Adequate legislative measures \\nand cost-effective, environmental friendly, \\ntechnological solution would be needed to \\naddress the issue. This article provides the \\nbasic information on electronic waste \\nmanagement in India.   \\n \\n \\n1. Introduction  \\n \\nThe \\ndiscarded \\nand \\nend-of-life \\nelectronics \\nproducts \\nranging \\nfrom \\ncomputers, equipment used in Information \\nand Communication Technology (ICT), \\nhome appliances, audio and video products \\nand all of their peripherals are popularly \\nknown as Electronic waste (E-waste). \\nThere is, however, no standard or \\ngenerally accepted definition of e-waste in \\nthe \\nworld. \\nIn \\nmost \\ncases, \\ne-waste \\ncomprises of the relatively expensive and \\nessentially durable products used for data \\nprocessing, \\ntelecommunications \\nor \\nentertainment in private households and \\nbusinesses. \\n \\nE-waste is not hazardous if it is \\nstocked in safe storage or recycled by \\nscientific methods or transported from one \\nplace to the other in parts or in totality in \\nthe formal sector. The e-waste can, \\nhowever, be considered hazardous if \\nrecycled by primitive methods. E-waste \\ncontains several substances such as heavy \\nmetals, plastics, glass etc., which can be \\npotentially toxic and hazardous to the \\nenvironment and human health, if not \\nhandled in an environmentally sound \\nmanner. E-waste recycling in the non-\\nformal sector by primitive methods can \\ndamage the environment.  \\n \\nThe ill effects of e-waste could be \\non soil through leaching of hazardous \\ncontents from landfills; in water due to \\ncontamination of rivers, wells and other \\nwater sources; in air due to emission of \\ngases and burning of e-waste. The \\n\\n\\nrecycling process, if not carried out \\nproperly, can cause damage to human \\nbeing through inhalation of gases during \\nrecycling, contact of the skin of the \\nworkers with hazardous substances and \\ncontact during acid treatment used in \\nrecovery process. \\n \\nThe \\nhazardous \\nand \\ntoxic \\nsubstances found in e-waste include lead \\n(Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in printed circuit \\nboards (PCBs). Lead is primarily found in \\nall electronic products/ assembly, cathode \\nray tubes (CRT) etc. Cadmium is found in \\nmonitor/ CRTs while there may be \\nmercury in switches and flat screen \\nmonitors. Mercury is also found in CFL, \\nrelays and some other specific products. \\nBesides \\nthe \\ncadmium \\nin \\ncomputer \\nbatteries, cadmium is also used for plating \\nmetal enclosures/ metal parts in sub \\nassemblies. Polychlorinated biphenyls are \\nfound in capacitors and transformers and \\nas brominated flame retardant on printed \\ncircuit boards, plastic casings, cable and \\npolyvinyl chloride (PVC) cable sheathing \\nfor insulation and PBD/PBDE in plastic \\nparts of electronics. \\n \\nNo exclusive study has so far been \\nmade to know the effect of the e-waste in \\nthe \\nenvironment. \\nFew \\nNGOs \\nhave, \\nhowever, found that the recycling of e-\\nwaste in non-formal sector is hazardous. \\nThese units use primitive, non-scientific, \\nand non-environment-friendly methods. \\nAs these units are working in unorganized \\nsector, no data is available to substantiate \\nthe fact that they are violating the \\nprevailing laws for labour, environmental \\nprotection and industry. \\nGreenpeace \\nhad \\nundertaken \\na \\nsurvey of the environmental pollution \\nduring \\nmanufacturing \\nof \\nelectronic \\nproducts in China, Thailand, Philippines \\nand \\nMexico \\n(source: \\nwww.greenpeace.org).  The study is an \\nassessment on pollution due to the use of \\nsome of the hazardous chemicals in the \\nmanufacture of electronic products in these \\ncountries. The industries included the \\nprinted circuit board and semiconductor \\nchip manufacturing units and various \\nassembly units of television, computers, \\nmonitors etc. No such study has been \\ncarried out in India.'"

Complex \\nNew Delhi-110 003, India, sandip@mit.gov.in  \\n \\n \\nAbstract \\n \\nElectronic waste (e-waste) is one of the \\nfastest growing waste streams in the \\ncountry. Growth of Information and \\nCommunication Technology sector has \\nenhanced the usage of the electronic \\nequipment \\nexponentially. \\nFaster \\nobsolescence and subsequent up-gradation \\nof \\nelectronics \\nproduct, \\nare \\nforcing \\nconsumers to discard old products, which \\nin turn accumulate huge e-waste to the \\nsolid waste stream. E-waste is growing in \\nIndia at the rate of 10%. Major recycling \\nof e-waste is carried out in the non-formal \\nsector using primitive and hazardous \\nmethods. Adequate legislative measures \\nand cost-effective, environmental friendly, \\ntechnological solution would be needed to \\naddress the issue. This article provides the \\nbasic information on electronic waste \\nmanagement in India.   \\n \\n \\n1. Introduction  \\n \\nThe \\ndiscarded \\nand \\nend-of-life \\nelectronics \\nproducts \\nranging \\nfrom \\ncomputers, equipment used in Information \\nand Communication Technology (ICT), \\nhome appliances, audio and video products \\nand all of their peripherals are popularly \\nknown as Electronic waste (E-waste). \\nThere is, however, no standard or \\ngenerally accepted definition of e-waste in \\nthe \\nworld. \\nIn \\nmost \\ncases, \\ne-waste \\ncomprises of the relatively expensive and \\nessentially durable products used for data \\nprocessing, \\ntelecommunications \\nor \\nentertainment in private households and \\nbusinesses. \\n \\nE-waste is not hazardous if it is \\nstocked in safe storage or recycled by \\nscientific methods or transported from one \\nplace to the other in parts or in totality in \\nthe formal sector. The e-waste can, \\nhowever, be considered hazardous if \\nrecycled by primitive methods. E-waste \\ncontains several substances such as heavy \\nmetals, plastics, glass etc., which can be \\npotentially toxic and hazardous to the \\nenvironment and human health, if not \\nhandled in an environmentally sound \\nmanner. E-waste recycling in the non-\\nformal sector by primitive methods can \\ndamage the environment.  \\n \\nThe ill effects of e-waste could be \\non soil through leaching of hazardous \\ncontents from landfills; in water due to \\ncontamination of rivers, wells and other \\nwater sources; in air due to emission of \\ngases and burning of e-waste. The \\n\\n\\nrecycling process, if not carried out \\nproperly, can cause damage to human \\nbeing through inhalation of gases during \\nrecycling, contact of the skin of the \\nworkers with hazardous substances and \\ncontact during acid treatment used in \\nrecovery process. \\n \\nThe \\nhazardous \\nand \\ntoxic \\nsubstances found in e-waste include lead \\n(Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in printed circuit \\nboards (PCBs). Lead is primarily found in \\nall electronic products/ assembly, cathode \\nray tubes (CRT) etc. Cadmium is found in \\nmonitor/ CRTs while there may be \\nmercury in switches and flat screen \\nmonitors. Mercury is also found in CFL, \\nrelays and some other specific products. \\nBesides \\nthe \\ncadmium \\nin \\ncomputer \\nbatteries, cadmium is also used for plating \\nmetal enclosures/ metal parts in sub \\nassemblies. Polychlorinated biphenyls are \\nfound in capacitors and transformers and \\nas brominated flame retardant on printed \\ncircuit boards, plastic casings, cable and \\npolyvinyl chloride (PVC) cable sheathing \\nfor insulation and PBD/PBDE in plastic \\nparts of electronics. \\n \\nNo exclusive study has so far been \\nmade to know the effect of the e-waste in \\nthe \\nenvironment. \\nFew \\nNGOs \\nhave, \\nhowever, found that the recycling of e-\\nwaste in non-formal sector is hazardous. \\nThese units use primitive, non-scientific, \\nand non-environment-friendly methods. \\nAs these units are working in unorganized \\nsector, no data is available to substantiate \\nthe fact that they are violating the \\nprevailing laws for labour, environmental \\nprotection and industry. \\nGreenpeace \\nhad \\nundertaken \\na \\nsurvey of the environmental pollution \\nduring \\nmanufacturing \\nof \\nelectronic \\nproducts in China, Thailand, Philippines \\nand \\nMexico \\n(source: \\nwww.greenpeace.org).  The study is an \\nassessment on pollution due to the use of \\nsome of the hazardous chemicals in the \\nmanufacture of electronic products in these \\ncountries. The industries included the \\nprinted circuit board and semiconductor \\nchip manufacturing units and various \\nassembly units of television, computers, \\nmonitors etc. No such study has been \\ncarried out in India.'),\n",
              " Document(page_content='2. Inventory of Electronics Waste \\n \\nActual data on generation or import \\nof e-waste is not currently available in \\nIndia. Several studies have been conducted \\nby various agencies to find out the \\ninventory of e-waste in the country. Most \\nof these studies are based on the model of \\nobsolescence of electronic products, which \\nneeds to be validated with the field data. A \\nsurvey was carried out by the Central \\nPollution Control Board (CPCB) during \\n2005. It was estimated that 1.347 lakh MT \\nof e-waste was generated in the country in \\nthe year 2005, which is expected to \\nincrease to about 8.0 lakh MT by 2012. \\nDuring 2007, Manufacturers’ association \\nfor Information Technology (MAIT), India \\nand GTZ, India had, however, carried out \\nan inventory on e-waste, arising out of \\nthree products: computers, mobile phones, \\nand televisions.
